# Application Repository

This repository contains various application configurations for our Kubernetes cluster, demonstrating different deployment methods:

1. Plain YAML
2. Helm Charts
3. Kustomize
4. Mixed approach (combining Kustomize and Helm)

Each directory contains example configurations for a simple web application.
